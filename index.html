                    <h3>Biographics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Narendranath was born in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), in the British India, into an affluent Bengali family. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was a devout housewife. From an early age, Narendranath showed great intellectual abilities and an inclination towards spirituality.

                            Education and Influence of Ramakrishna:
                            In 1881, Narendranath entered the Presidency College in Kolkata, where he studied Western philosophy, religion, and history. He was also deeply interested in the spiritual aspect of life and was drawn to the teachings of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a mystic saint who became his spiritual mentor.
                            
                            Under the guidance of Ramakrishna, Narendranath explored various spiritual paths and developed a deep understanding of Hindu philosophy, particularly Advaita Vedanta. After the passing of Ramakrishna in 1886, Narendranath took the monastic vows and assumed the name "Swami Vivekananda."
                            
                            Founding of Ramakrishna Mission and Global Outreach:
                            Swami Vivekananda embarked on a journey to spread the teachings of Ramakrishna and Hindu philosophy in India and abroad. In 1893, he represented Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions held in Chicago, delivering his famous speech that began with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America." This speech introduced Vedanta and Yoga to the Western audience, making him an instant sensation and establishing him as a prominent figure on the world stage.
                            
                            After the Parliament of Religions, Swami Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, a spiritual organization dedicated to serving humanity through educational, healthcare, and social welfare initiatives. The mission aimed to uplift the underprivileged and foster religious harmony. Swami Vivekananda emphasized the importance of selfless service and spiritual unity among people of different religions.
                            
                            Philosophy and Teachings:
                            Swami Vivekananda's philosophy was a harmonious blend of spirituality, social reform, and practical living. He believed in the divinity of the soul, the oneness of all religions, and the idea that every individual could manifest their inner divinity through self-discipline, knowledge, and service to others.
                            
                            His teachings focused on the need for individual growth, character development, and the pursuit of truth. He advocated for the eradication of social evils such as caste discrimination, poverty, and illiteracy, and promoted the idea of "Daridra Narayana Seva" (serving the poor as manifestations of the Divine).
                            
                            Legacy and Impact:
                            Swami Vivekananda's impact on Indian society and the world at large cannot be overstated. His teachings continue to inspire millions of people to this day, and his ideas on universal brotherhood, religious tolerance, and self-realization are considered timeless.
                            
                            Swami Vivekananda passed away on July 4, 1902, at the age of 39, but his legacy lives on through the Ramakrishna Mission and the Vedanta Society, which he established. His birthday, January 12, is celebrated as National Youth Day in India to honor his contributions and inspire the younger generation.
                            
                            Swami Vivekananda's life and teachings have left an indelible mark on the world, bridging the gap between East and West, and offering profound insights into the human potential for spiritual growth and social upliftment.
